win32 1.2.x build environment
==============================

This is a scripted installation of an 1.2.x build environment for Windows.
It mirrors the style and content of shipped releases in the 1.2.x-series
(so it mostly uses DLLs).

For now, please see the README file for the win32-static build environment
for 1.2.x for more information on how to build this thing:

   buildenv/1.3.x/win32-static/README
